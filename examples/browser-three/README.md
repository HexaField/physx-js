# PhsyX JS Example

A simple example showing how to use physx-js with webpack. 

Most of the simulation setup code was copied from @prestomation's [demo](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/issues/288#issuecomment-571765523)

You can spin this up by running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

**Note:** Using emscripten output files (js + wasm) with webpack is a little tedious, if you have any improvements please enlighten me!
